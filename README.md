##AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection & Precautionary Advicer ðŸŒ¿

 This project is a web-based AI tool that detects plant diseases from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Once the disease is detected, the system displays helpful precautionary advice directly within the application. It is designed to support farmers, agricultural students, and researchers by offering fast, AI-powered plant disease diagnosis and solutions.

##Features

â€¢ Upload a plant leaf image through the web app.
â€¢ Predicts the disease using a trained CNN model.
â€¢ Displays built-in precautionary advice based on the disease.
â€¢ User-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.
â€¢ Helps in early identification and control of plant diseases.

##Technologies Used

â€¢ Python - Programming language
â€¢ TensorFlow / Keras â€“ For the CNN deep learning model
â€¢ SQLite (User authentication)
â€¢ NumPy
â€¢ Streamlit â€“ For the interactive web app
â€¢ OpenCV â€“ For image preprocessing
